                <p>
                    July, 2023. Me and my family wet to visit our relatives Lebak, Sultan Kudarat. This is my mother side's hometown. There I met a lot of people that I had no idea I'm related with. I met my grandfather and grandmother on my mother's side as well as my cousins, which Im with in this photo. This was taken at Lebak's famous round about. The province vibe  was all over the air and it made me feel at peace. I would love to go there again soon together with my family.

                <h2>Kalamansig Road trip</h2>

                    July, 2023. This shot was taken at Kalamansig, a neighbouring town of Tibpuan, Lebak where we were residing. My cousins and I went to Sultan Kudarat State Univesity to one of my cousins and had a beautiful roadtrip going there. The ambiance was nice, air was fresh, I mean talk abut province life! Afterwards, we took a detour to their park where this shot was taken. Unfortunately, due to the time that we went, we did not encounter a lot of other locals and vendors around the park. This was a fun experience, having a roadtrip together with my cousins, in an unfamiliar province, a good memory to hold.
